~> **Role Requirement** To use the `taikun_project` resource, you need a Manager or Partner account.

-> **Organization ID** `organization_id` can be specified for the Partner role, it otherwise defaults to the user's organization. If specified, the project's cloud credential must be in the same organization.

## Current limitations of the `vm` and `disk` blocks.

!> **Standalone VMs** Reordering `vm` blocks is not yet supported.
Adding a `vm` block to a `taikun_project` resource is only supported if it is added
below the preexisting `vm` blocks in the `taikun_project` resource.
If you insert a `vm` block at the beginning or somewhere in the middle of a list of
`vm` blocks, the VMs declared in the blocks that follow will be recreated!
Deletion of `vm` blocks is also only supported for trailing blocks.
If you delete a `vm` block at the beginning or somewhere in the middle of a list of
`vm` blocks, the VMs declared in the blocks that follow will be recreated!

!> **Standalone VM disks** Reordering `disk` blocks is not yet supported.
Adding a `disk` block to a `vm` block is only supported if it is added
below the preexisting `disk` blocks in the `vm` block.
If you insert a `disk` block at the beginning or somewhere in the middle of a list of
`disk` blocks, the disks declared in the blocks that follow will be recreated!
Deletion of `disk` blocks is also only supported for trailing blocks.
If you delete a `disk` block at the beginning or somewhere in the middle of a list of
`disk` blocks, the disks declared in the blocks that follow will be recreated!

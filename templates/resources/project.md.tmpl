~> **Role Requirement** To use the `taikun_project` resource, you need a Manager or Partner account.

-> **Organization ID** `organization_id` can be specified for the Partner role, it otherwise defaults to the user's organization. If specified, the project's cloud credential must be in the same organization.

!> **Standalone VMs** Reordering `vm` and `disk` blocks is not yet supported.
Reordering these blocks will break your project!
If you wish to delete multiple of these blocks, delete them one at a time and run `terraform apply` each time.
If you wish to add one or multiple of these blocks, add them below the ones that are already there.
